        In "Shutter Island," Teddy Daniels is portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio.
        Teddy is a U.S. Marshal sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance
        of an inmate at Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental institution for the
        criminally insane located on Shutter Island. As the film progresses, it
        becomes apparent that Teddy is not just on the island to solve a case;
        he is also grappling with personal demons and a traumatic past.

        Teddy is haunted by memories of his experiences as a soldier liberating
        the Dachau concentration camp during World War II. These memories
        contribute to his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
        and play a significant role in shaping his character. Throughout the
        investigation, Teddy becomes increasingly paranoid and begins to
        question the reality of his surroundings.

        As the plot unfolds, Teddy's mental state becomes a central focus, and
        the line between his perceptions and the truth becomes increasingly
        blurred. The film explores Teddy's psyche, delving into the impact of
        his past traumas on his present state of mind. Leonardo DiCaprio's
        performance is widely praised for capturing the complexity of Teddy's
        character and contributing to the overall suspense and psychological
        intensity of the film.
